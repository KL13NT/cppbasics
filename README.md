> Provided to you by Nabil Tharwat. Valarium President and Creator.

> This tutorial is built mainly for Valarium. I'm going to cover all the way to structs and maybe further if requested, tho no plans of extending are put yet. 

> Disclaimer: I'm in no way a C++ professional, I'm just a student just like you and could have made mistakes, tho not big ones I hope. If you see something that needs improvement don't hesitate to mention me on Discord!
